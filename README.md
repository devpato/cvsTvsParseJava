# dev-assessment
This is a brief assessment to gauge development skills

# Given information : 
1. You are given two input files : 
- products.csv
- products.tsv
2. These files contain a list of products
3. The CSV and TSV are both valid formats
4. A product's uniqueness is determined by it's SKU
5. products.csv contains more acccurate information than products.tsv
6. Third party libraries are allowed for parsing & transforming data


# Your assignment is : 
1. Parse the CSV and TSV files into Product objects
2. Store all unique products in memory (with the most accurate information)
3. Transform these products into two different data formats, JSON and XML
4. Final output should be products.json and products.xml files
5. Send your final zip file with NO output files (include 3rd party libs)
6. Provide instructions on how to run the application from a terminal (consider how 3rd party libs are imported
   when running the application)


# The assignment will be assessed on :
- Code properly zipped with NO output files
- Run instructions work properly
- Completing the assignment components correctly
- Method used to transform the data into json / xml 
- Coding style


The assessment should take anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple hours to complete. If you're unsure of a specific
requirement, write down your assumptions in "assumptions.txt" and continue forward.
